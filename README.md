# push_swap



**Push_swap** is a project that teaches you about sorting algorithms and how to optimize them.

The project involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations (**push**, **swap** and **rotate**) and minimizing the number of moves.


At the beginning, you must have one **stack**, called **stack a** with all your numbers placed next to each other. 

With the help of the operations below, at the very end, all the numbers in your stack a will have to be sorted. 

At the end, you don't need to return the sorted list, just the sequence of operations to sort the list.

You can normalize the list if you need to

To do this, you can have a second empty stack, called the **stack b**, on which you can temporarily send elements. Here are the operations:


- `sa (swap a)`: Swap the first 2 elements at the top of the stack a. Does nothing if there is only one or none.

- `sb (swap b)` : Swap the first 2 elements at the top of the stack b. Does nothing if there is only one or none.

- `ss` : sa and sb at the same time.

- `pa (push a)`: Takes the first element on top of b and puts it on a. Does nothing if b is empty.

- `pb (push b)`: Takes the first element on top of a and puts it on b. Does nothing if a is empty.

- `ra (rotate a)`: Shifts all the elements of the stack a up by one position. The first element becomes the last.

- `rb (rotate b)` : Shifts all the elements of the stack b one position upwards. The first element becomes the last one.

- `rr` : ra and rb at the same time. 

- `rra` (reverse rotate a): Shifts all elements of the stack down one position. the stack a. The last element becomes the first. 

- `rrb` (reverse rotate b): Shifts all the elements of the stack b one position downwards. the stack b. The last element becomes the first. 

- `rrr` : rra and rrb at the same time.
